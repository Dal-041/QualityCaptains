# QualityCaptains
A gameplay-focused skills overhaul for the game Starsector.

QC emphasizes an even utility of skills and good balance for every playstyle. The skill effects enhance the texture of the game's combat and campaign gameplay, making choices have weight but never feel unfair. 
The mod is almost completely configurable, from the smallest tweak to the grandest game mechanic - some skills can even add or swap effects entirely.
QC also features optional "milestone" perks are automatically awarded to the player when they achieve certain vanilla plot events, also completely configurable.
