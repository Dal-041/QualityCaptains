	* Milestones have their own configuration settings
	* Milestones take up to week to appear (or disappear)
	* Milestones must be toggled off to reassign skills. Vanilla bug! The LunaLib setting makes this really easy.

- Corrected a cosmetic issue that listed the default Automated Ship limit even when it was set unused. This did not impact stats. 
- Can be added to ongoing games, but skill additions may mean QC can not be removed from ongoing games. Poke me if you're desperate for a vanilla-only toggle.
- Unified QC settings and Lunalib settings. You will only ever need to change them in one place. Wow!
	* Configuration files have changed from all previous versions, including betas
	* For automatically loaded settings, edit the CSV, otherwise load in dynamic settings each startup by opening LunaLib at the main menu and hitting "Save All"
